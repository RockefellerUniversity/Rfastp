Description: Rfastp is an R wrapper of fastp developed in c++.
    fastp performs quality control for fastq files. including low quality bases
    trimming, polyX trimming, adapter auto-detection and trimming, paired-end
    reads merging, UMI sequence/id handling. Rfastp can concatenate multiple
    files into one file (like shell command cat) and accept multiple files as
    input.
